This page serves as a collection of examples and detailed explinations summarising the process of differential cross-section measurements in the H :math:`\rightarrow` ZZ :math:`\rightarrow` 4l channlel. The very first section (Quick Start) will focus on the practical set of instructions, akin to those found in the official `README <https://github.com/vukasinmilosevic/Fiducial_XS/blob/CMSSW_10_X_VM_docs/README.rst>`_ file of the framework's `github page <https://github.com/vukasinmilosevic/Fiducial_XS/tree/CMSSW_10_X>`_. The following sections dive into more details about each step, which is why new students are highly encouraged to explore this route.

.. note::
   Most, if not all, of the examples presented in this page are based on the currently ongoing efforts for the `HIG-21-009 <https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/cadilines?line=HIG-21-009&tp=an&id=2445&ancode=HIG-21-009>`_ publicaition.
